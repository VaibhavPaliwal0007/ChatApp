# Chat-App

- I have basically made a chat-app using NodeJS making use of sockets.
- In this you can chat through other people present in the same room and you can also send your current location. 

## Here are some images

# You will get notified when a user join or left a room.

# You can also send a link of your current location.

The app is designed in such a way that if you are reading old chats and someone dropped a message, you will not get directed to the last message, but if you are at the last message, there is automatic scroll if someone drops a message.
